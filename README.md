### Aim
This paper aims to provide a probabilistic approach to pixel-wise segmentation - SegNet. This paper also aims to extend deep convolutional encoder-decoder neural network architecture to Bayesian CNN which can produce a probabilistic segmentation output. 
### Result
Modelling uncertainity improved the performance by 2-3% compared to the state-of-art architectures like SegNet, FCN and Dilatio Network. Significant improvement in performance was observered when fed with smaller datasets.
